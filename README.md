# Planned Features
- A popout "favorites" panel where you can save images you find for future reference.
  - This feature will likely also use LocalStorage to save your favorites between browser sessions, but I may also add an "export" button to generate and save a TXT file containing a list of all your favorites that can then later be re-imported to your favorites.
